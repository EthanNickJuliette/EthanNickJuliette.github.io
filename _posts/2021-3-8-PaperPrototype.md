### Full Paper Prototype
![All Pages Combined](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Part 1 of Comibned Page.jpeg?raw=true)
![All Pages Combined 2](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Part 2 of Combined Pages.jpeg?raw=true)
#### Individual Pages in Prototype
![Page #1](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #1.jpeg?raw=true)

This is the first page when you open the app. You can log in with your HM email if you have already registered, 
and if you are new, you can sign up with your HM email.
![Page #2](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #2.jpeg?raw=true)

Following the sign in/sign up page, the user will be directed to the home page. Here, every club will be listed
along with the “Statistics” and “Just For Fun” page - for the user to choose what they want to focus on. 
There will also be a down arrow towards the bottom right of the screen, indicating to the user that they can 
scroll down to view more clubs.
![Page #3](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #3.jpeg?raw=true)

If the user clicks on the “Send Out A Poll” button at the bottom left side of the home page, the user will be directed
to this screen. To successfully submit a poll, the user will have to fill in their horace mann email (just in case we
need to contact them), the question they want to ask, and the answer choices that will correspond with the question. 
Lastly, they will have an option to remain anonymous when their poll is published.
![Page #4](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #4.jpeg?raw=true)

After the user has successfully published a poll, there will be a thank you screen and a button that will lead them 
back to the home page.
![Page #5](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #5.jpeg?raw=true)

This is the page that the app brings you to after pressing the Club Rooms button on the 2nd picture. You can scroll 
and see a list of all clubs, and star the clubs you are interested in, which then will show up on the left, with the 
club room listed. 
![Page #6](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #6.jpeg?raw=true)

This page allows for administrators or club leaders to schedule a club meeting. When on this page, they are required 
to input their email, date, and time for their club meeting.
![Page #7](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #7.jpeg?raw=true)

This is the page that offers the user to do different polls from a certain club, and they just click one of the options
and are taken to another page to put their answer on.
![Page #8](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #8.jpeg?raw=true)

This last photo is where you answer the question, it is either a yes or no question, or you can submit another response.
You then press the submit button and it takes you to the next page.
![Page #9](https://github.com/EthanNickJuliette/EthanNickJuliette.github.io/blob/master/Page #9.jpeg?raw=true)

This is the thank you page after someone answers a poll. 

### Team Project Page
This prototype demonstrates a user pressing through each of the buttons, which will allow them to publish polls 
anonymously or not anonymously associated with each club, check club rooms, and answer poll questions as well as view others’ 
responses. The post it notes / colored boxes demonstrate a button that can be pressed to bring you to the next image. 
The two tasks that we decided to focus on here - sending out polls and scheduling a club meeting - were emphasized in 
this particular prototype compared to our previous design. In the case of sending out polls, we added the slightly more
convenient option of allowing the user to add however many choices they want in their answer by including an “add
another answer choice” button. Additionally, we gave the user the option to remain anonymous if they want to. In the 
case of scheduling a club meeting, we made the design a lot more convenient by adding a club room button at the bottom 
right side of the home page. This allows students to more efficiently check their club room. This is better than our 
previous design because we originally planned to email the club room to the person who signed up for a club meeting. 
However, we realized that this would worsen the problem that this app aims to solve, which is trying to lessen the 
amount of emails that people in the HM community get. Overall, the tasks of scheduling a club meeting and sending out 
polls was highlighted and made easier in this prototype.
