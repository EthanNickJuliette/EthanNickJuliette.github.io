#### Preliminary Information: Who is in the team, what are their schedules like, any extracurricular commitments requiring extra time, what are everyone’s skill sets, what are people’s general goals with respect to this course and project?

Team members: Juliette, Ethan, and Nick
Schedules:
  Ethan: robotics, model congress, and parliamentary debate
  Juliette: athletics and slearn
  Nick: Slearn, Debate
Skill sets:
  Juliette Nick and Ethan: comp sci 1 and 2

  General goals: learn how to make an app and learn about the process and swift. Also, we want to make a viable app that people can use.

#### Guiding Principles: What is the team’s philosophy? What are some ground rules everyone can agree on? What is your mission?
Everyone does a bit everyday so that all the work can accumulate into a finished product well before the deadline
Mission: We all have time to not only complete our own tasks, but to peer review each other’s work so that we are all comfortable with our finished product. 

#### Focus on Purpose: What is the purpose of your project? What is your goal – as you begin your project now, what would you like to have accomplished by the end of this project?
The purpose of this project is to create an app, with everyone putting in equal effort and working well together. While we hope to finish the app in this class, it is more important that we collaborate together and learn about the process. 

#### Group Roles: Can be specifically defined for each person or can be general and open-ended

Our rolls are open-ended, everyone will do different things depending on the task and what we need to get done as a whole.

#### Division of Labor: Similar to group roles, but in this section you should specifically outline how the workload will be distributed among the group members.
We will equally split up each assignment, and if certain group members prefer to focus on a certain section, they will be able to work on that. Otherwise, we will assign each person roughly ⅓ of the section.

#### Team Name: What is your team name and what is the rationale behind it?
Our team name is Cheetah Polls.

#### Team Logo: What will be your project logo and what is the rationale behind it?
Team logo: it will use the HM logo, since this app is dedicated to the HM community. It has the word Comms on it so signify communication. 


#### Team Plan: Write your plan for who will do what as you work on the Group Project Proposal.
We have assigned a question for each team member to answer. 


#### Meeting Management: How often will you meet? How will you coordinate when to meet? How will you communicate to plan meetings? How will the meetings be conducted, what are your expectations for each group member? How will you support each other so that if someone is having a bad day, the meeting can still be successful? How will you make decisions, what happens if people disagree? How will you manage meeting remotely? How will you manage meetings in person if one or more members are remote?

We will meet during class and if need be, we will meet outside of class, but mostly work on our own and meet during class to check-in
We will coordinate meetings at the end of every class or by slacking each other.
If we meet in class, we can just work together in person, but if someone or everyone is remote, we will zoom
Each meeting will be conducted kind of similarly as each person will say what they have done and what they still need to do, and then everyone can give each other help with their tasks either through constructive criticism or giving them new ideas.
If somebody is having a bad day, or is extremely stressed, then the other 2 people or another person in the group can always do some of the work for the other group member, or do all of their work. We can meet as 2 people and decide how to break up their work.
We will make decisions as a collective group .

#### Documentation/Accountability: How will you record the pertinent information from a meeting? How will you use each meeting to make an actionable plan for your work and your next meeting? How will you make sure people are held accountable for doing their part?
We will have shared google documents so that we can all view and add to it 
In each meeting, we will begin by assigning sections for each person
Each person will put in their own effort; we all have similar standards and will be the best group members we can be

#### Rewards/Punishments: How will you motivate yourselves and each other to do your part and deliver the best possible results? What happens if someone fails to meet their commitments? How is success rewarded? How will you respond to failure to adhere to this product? How will you provide each other with helpful and honest feedback without disrupting the process or hurting the team dynamic?
We will all keep in touch and check-in with what we have completed and congratulate/motivate each other depending on if someone is well ahead of their projected pace, or if a person is behind schedule. 
We won’t harshly critique each other if we think that something can be improved on, but instead, constructively critique each other without hurting each other’s feelings. 

#### Follow-Up: How will you check in with each other to make sure this contract is serving the needs of your team and, in turn, that your team is adhering to the contract? How will you revise the contract, should the need arise? How will you make decisions regarding revisions to the contract? What happens if someone on the team has an issue at any point during the process?
We will revisit this contract when needed, and if a problem does arise, we will make sure to confer with what we wrote here. If someone is not adhering to the contract, we will remind them of this document. If we need to revise the contract, we will meet so that everyone is informed of the changes. We will take a quick vote, to make sure everyone is in agreement. If we are not all in agreement, we will compromise. If someone has an issue, they should ask to meet all together and talk about the issues they have.
