I observed a student who is currently taking the level 400 statistics. He is a junior at Horace Mann. He has been at Horace Mann since middle school. 
I wanted to interview him since he experiences both sides of our problem. 
Since our app relates to our first class system, I first observed him opening his email and how he typically receives assignments. 
This was the observations of watching him as a student and receiving emails and navigating through first class.
Additionally, I asked him how we would plan for sending future polls as he is in the statistics class and will likely have to send out poll results soon.
I learned a lot especially since he had insight on both issues. The first issue he discussed was being flooded with emails, mostly from the Record, about polls to take. 
As a stat student, I learned that it can be frustrating if students do not respond to the poll since there is not enough data to work with. 
This often happens, especially when the poll questions may be personal or just long so students don't want to fill them out. 
I uncovered a lot of insight, particularly from the point of someone who sends out polls, since although he has yet to send out a poll, he has planned for it.
I did not encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or receving information. /

For the next inquiries, we plan to keep the overall process the same. I was able to learn a lot of information and I think the contextual inquiry was overall successful. 
For the next inquiries, we may add a few more guided questions since the "activity" we observe users doing is relatively short and it may be more helpful to plan some topics to discuss while the user shows their email and/or their process for sending out polls.
