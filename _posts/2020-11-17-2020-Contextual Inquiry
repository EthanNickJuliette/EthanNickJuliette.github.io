I observed a student who is currently taking the level 400 statistics. He is a junior at Horace Mann. He has been at Horace Mann since middle school. 
Since our app relates to our first class system, I observed him opening his email and how he typically receives assignments. 
I wanted to interview him since he experiences both sides of our problem. 
Additionally, I asked him how we would plan for sending future polls as he is in the statistics class.
What did you learn?
What tasks, problems, or opportunities did you uncover?
Did you encounter any difficulties establishing rapport or getting the information you need?

What are your plans for the remaining inquiries?
How do you plan to change your protocol based on what you learned in your first inquiry?
