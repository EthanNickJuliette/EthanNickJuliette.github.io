## Our Proposal: HM comms
  A general, yet major problem that we noticed in the HM community was that communication is definitely not at its most convenient form-especially during a pandemic. First Class, the app that Horace Mann makes their students use in order to communicate with the rest of the hm community, certainly isn’t the most effective app. Students often glance at their emails without paying close attention to the ones that don’t have as much of an affect on them as others. For instance, students divert all their attention and time to the emails that are specifically to them (maybe a teacher responding to an email that the student sent) or the ones that are related to their actual classes (potentially a change in a test date), rather than emails that are sent to many students and have less of an affect on them. This makes many questions/polls to many students less likely to be filled out(or filled out without care), making the data and information collected quite questionable. However, specifically, we wanted to focus on clubs because of how great of a reputation and effect it has on many students. With the covid-19 pandemic and the struggles that come with it such as social distancing and the limited amount of students per room at a time, we noticed that an efficient way to sign up for meetings was also necessary in order to ensure the safety of students. Therefore, we thought the culmination of creating a space where students and teachers could send out polls and questions to the rest of the community and to also allow students and teachers to sign up for club meetings would make communication a lot more convenient. \

    HM has a huge variety of clubs, but with that brings issues of communication. As Horace Mann students and faculty, we constantly are receiving first class emails and the dings are persistent. Many times, these emails are crucial from our teachers informing us about relevant issues for class. However, sometimes these emails are drowned about by the many emails from students wanting to receive answers to their polls. Students are constantly under the pressure of academic rigor and don’t always have the time to fill out a poll that takes 30 seconds too long or forget to  come back to an email. This creates an inconvenience to both users; students are flooded by emails and ignore the poll emails, while students who need students to take the polls are frustrated by the lack of response.  Additionally, during Mondays and Thursdays, students get tons of emails from club meetings or other situations, informing them of specific club locations. communication is really key especially during the pandemic. So, the other tab deals with keeping track of  rooms. This is especially crucial as we are in the midst of a pandemic, so students should not be roaming the hallways and should either be in a classroom or designated seating space. Furthermore, there are restrictions to the number of students in each room so organization and preparedness is key, One positive of this current situation is that the emails can be helpful if you get notifications so that you are reminded of a poll to take or a club meeting. We will hope to preserve this aspect by utilizing notifications in our app as well.  \

  We, as a group, must also realize the prospective users of our app and stakeholders that will come along with that. We feel that the users of this app will mostly be the HM students along with club leaders. The regular HM students will be the people responding to the polls and they will also be signing up for certain clubs that they are interested in. Furthermore, certain HM students like students in AP Statistics will be using this app. But, they will use this app to post their own polls for their class to collect data. Also, club leaders will be using this app. The club leaders will also be able to post polls for their clubs, but they will also be able to book a place for their club to meet on I period days. Furthermore, they will be able to see the amount of people that are signing up for their club and they won’t be clueless like they usually are, as there is simply no way to know as of now. The main stakeholders of our app design would include club advisors. Club advisors usually have to worry a good amount about the place and the amount of people for the club that they advise. Especially during this covid era, the idea of knowing the amount of people showing up to a meeting is especially useful to them as they know how much room they need for social distance. The three contextual inquiry participants that we have decided we would want to interview are an AP Statistics student, Julia Goldberg who is the head of the Record, and Mr. Lee, who is a computer science teacher. In order to effectively interview our participants within a week, each of us would do an interview for each of our participants and then after we interviewed them, we would reconvene and combine all of the information we gained.\

    For our interview with our three contextual inquiry participants, we would interview them by discussing our app idea with them. In order to interview all of them, each one of us would choose a certain participant to interview and try to schedule a meeting with them by finding similar free periods. Then, we would make sure to maintain our social distance in the interview as we would go into the classroom and stay six feet apart or use one of the plastic barriers. We will interview them by meeting up with each participant and explaining our app to them, and how it could end up helping their lives as club leaders, students, and teachers. Then, we would ask them to give us feedback on how they think that the app could be changed so it could be used more effectively for them. Also, we would want to know how they previously would determine the room they would meet in, how/if they knew how to socially distance themselves with the amount of students coming, and how they would send out polls in their separate ways. Although these steps may seem simple, we could use them to improve our design. All of this combined would create a safe, and effective interview that would hopefully benefit both us and our participants by allowing us to refine our ideas to make their lives easier in the future at HM.
