### Task 1: Finding club room on Monday or Thursday
  Although this task isn’t very strenuous or difficult to do, currently, it is complicated and stressful. It’s a Monday afternoon and students have just finished their H period class. Students receive lots of email during this time, so they must navigate the busy and hectic hallways while scrolling through their phones to find the right email. To complete this task currently, they must be emailed by club leaders ahead of time about room and timing. Although this sounds easy, it often isn’t conveyed efficiently. Some emails say “Meeting room in 329,” but fail to specify for what club. Some emails don’t put the room in the title, so that it takes students longer to load the email to search for the room. Some club leaders have to change the room they are in because of an overlapping scheduling issue with another club. This leads to students having to scramble frantically on the different floors to ensure they arrive on time. However, there could be a more efficient way to complete this task to ensure students do not arrive late and are not flooded by emails during Monday or Thursdays. 
  
### Task 2: Sending out ap stat surveys
  AP stat students have to come up with a stat project which is largely based on data that they receive from students. Some assignments are sent out to “randomly selected students” while some are sent out to everyone. Although these surveys are easy to ignore as students, these are crucial for stat students to receive enough data to form a project. Additionally, it’s not enough if just a few students reply; as stat students learn, the bigger the sample size, the more accurate the survey is, and the better it represents the population. Therefore, it’s necessary to have an adequate sample size and a good number of responses from students. Using google forms works, but can be dubious, especially if a few students send their survey out at similar times since HM students may be less likely to respond to both.

### Task 3: Sending out club surveys. (ex: record, review, other clubs that need data)
  Another task that users already perform is sending out polls for various clubs. Publications such as the record, or other clubs that need data in order to write an issue need an efficient way of sending out polls, and getting the HM community to fill them out. However, the main problem with sending out surveys via the first class emailing system is that students often don’t fill the polls out. Especially because Horace Mann is a school known for its academic rigor, students often don’t even have the few seconds that it takes to fill out the forms, especially because there is no incentive. Often, writers and editors for the record would include this data in their articles, without mentioning the inconvenience of the polling system. This can sometimes be misleading as there is a potential chance that data does not truly reflect the ideas of all of the HM community. 
  
### Task 4: People are just generally curious about opinions in the HM community
  An example of a new task is students who are curious about the HM community and want to ask any questions that they are curious about. This task would utlize a place where students/teachers can ask questions about anything they are curious about is essential. A few examples of these questions would be, “Who else saw the eagle flying around on campus today?”, or “Would you be interested in a publication that talks about (fill in the blank)?” Students in the HM community do not already have a platform to perform this task because the first class emailing system does not serve this purpose. Additionally, even if students were comfortable with and allowed to send these random questions out to the school, very few students would fill them out and they would only contribute to the constant emailing spam students and teachers receive daily. 
  
### Task 5: Connecting with the entirety of the HM community 
   As of now at HM, we aren’t extremely connected with each other through the grades between Upper Division, Middle division, and Lower Division, and even within the Upper Division, as there is a pretty stark divide between the upperclassmen and lowerclassmen. This dynamic can often be pretty toxic and it can be hard to talk with people who are not in your grade, although one may want to.  From my time at HM, I don’t really interact with kids from other grades often unless it is something like Robotics or other clubs. Therefore, a future task could be viewing other interests at HM and finding people with similar interests to connect and form new friendships, which would improve communication among different grade levels. For example, if there was a way to view if people like to knit or something, these people could all connect in a less formal way than forming a club.  Checking poll responses to questions to see who has similar opinions to you would be an important way for HM members to connect. 
   
### Task 6: As a club leader/advisor, sending out club information in a less stressful way
  As a club leader or club advisor at HM, it is extremely stressful to run clubs because of how the system is run at the moment. As of now, it is impossible to know how many students are coming to your club meeting, and if you will need more space or not. Especially during the pandemic, it is extremely pertinent to have enough space to social distance so having this way to allow kids to sign up for certain clubs allows club advisors and leaders to have an idea of who is going to show up, so they can have enough space to stay safe. Also, booking rooms seems like it is a pain. Additionally, the club leaders have to remember to constantly send emails reminding club members what room they are in before meetings. A future ideal task would be an easy way to send out room information and see how many people would attend without spamming first class emails.

####  Juliette’s Design
This design is going to use a tab system, where the first page will provide the two general task ideas, polls and clubs, that the app will encompass. This main design clearly splits the 2 purposes of the app. After the user clicks on one of the two tabs, they will be taken to a new page that goes into the specifics. After the user clicks on the polls tab, they will be taken to a page that lists out the different polls which are labelled by their club or general reason for it. On the second tab that states clubs, it brings a new page that lists out your clubs.

The 4 tasks supported are sending club surveys, checking polls/connecting with HM, finding a club room and sending out AP stat surveys. First, to send club surveys, you press the tab that is labelled polls, which brings you to a page with polls listed sorted by most recently at top. At the top left, there is a plus sign to submit a poll, and would choose a shape that corresponds to the club. Similarly, to send an AP stat survey, you would go through the same steps except label it for AP Stat.  To check polls or if you are curious about the HM community, you stay on this same page and can answer the polls by clicking on them or can look at responses. Each poll is organized by a shape that symbolizes why someone asked the poll (ex: for fun, for the Record…) To find a club room, you would press the second tab that states clubs. This brings you to a page that states “Your Clubs”, in which from the directory, you would star clubs you are part of which then show up in this page.

#### Nick’s Design: 
This design will list some clubs for the user to choose from on the home page. However, the sections listed on this page are not entirely exclusive to just clubs as there will also be a “Statistics” tab where students enrolled in a statistics course can post a poll to collect data. Additionally, there will be a “Just For Fun” tab which will allow anyone in the HM community to answer questions that do not have to be related to a club. The idea for this design is mainly to keep everything organized; rather than listing a bunch of various polls, the user can choose which club they would like to focus on. Users will also not only be constrained to answering polls, but will also be able to send them out, as indicated by the “Send out poll!” button at the bottom left of the home page. This button will be unique from the other buttons on the page - kind of having a comic book design - hopefully attracting users to this button. 

4 tasks that are supported with this design are finding a club room, sending out club surveys, sending out AP stat surveys, and people being generally curious about opinions in the HM community. To find a room for a club meeting, users can click on the club that they would like to schedule a meeting for(all clubs are listed on the home page). Then, when directed to a screen with the two options, “Polls” and “Schedule A Club Meeting,” the user will click on the latter, directing them to a form to fill out. This form will ask the user to fill in their email and the date and time that would best work for a meeting. One of the HM Comms staff members will then email the appropriate room number to the user, thus completing the “Schedule A Club Meeting” process. To send out club surveys, the user can click the “Send Out Poll!” button at the bottom left of the home page. They will then be directed to a form, asking them for their email and the question and answer choices of the poll, and the section(The Record, Statistics, Just For Fun, etc.) that this poll pertains to. Then, the user can hit the “Submit” button, successfully directing their poll proposition to one of the HM Comms staff members, who will then moderate it. To send out a Statistics poll, the user can follow the same initial steps of sending out a club poll, except they can change the section name to “Statistics.” Lastly, this design will allow people to collect opinions in the HM community by answering polls. When the user clicks on the club that they would like to focus on, they can click the “Polls” button, leading to a bunch of polls pertaining to that club. From there, users can click on the poll they would like to answer, and then submit their answer to the poll.

#### Ethan’s Design: 
This design is going to have a pretty simple design. So, we will start off with our home page with HM Comms on the top of the page, and on that page there will be a list of polls for certain clubs and classes. Within each box, there will be two sections, the poll question, and then a more info box on the right. There will also be random polls interspersed throughout the polls for clubs and classes. Then, on the right side of each box, this more info box will be a portion designated to flipping to another page. This page that is brought up will have a brief description of each club and what they are for. Then, there will be another button under the description where you can click to sign up for a meeting. This will either send you to a google doc or have a software embedded within the app to sign up for that club where you will put in your name, and it will then show you the time and room for the meeting. You then click on confirm and you can attend that meeting. The poll portion of the home page will give the poll question, then you will be able to click on the poll, and it will take you to another page. This other page will have the poll question on it, then it will give you an option to respond, and put your name which will be optional. Finally, you can click the confirm button, and your response will be submitted. Lastly, each page will have a back arrow to allow the user to go back to the previous page that they were on.
