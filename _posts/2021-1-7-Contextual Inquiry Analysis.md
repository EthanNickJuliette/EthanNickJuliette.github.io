### Contextual Inquiry Analysis
  * We began planning our topic by investigating issues related to communication at Horace Mann. We pretty quickly realized that most of the issues stem from the first class email system we use at HM. So, we zoomed in on problems with first class communication, and based our contextual inquiry around this.
  
  * For one contextual inquiry, we interviewed a teacher in the computer science department with the initials LL. We interviewed him in order to gain the perspective of a stakeholder of the app. The interview went pretty well, and it was pretty concise. We chose him in specific because our other inquiries were with potential users. Therefore, gaining the perspective of a stakeholder is extremely valuable in our design process. He was able to give more information on how the app could be more helpful to him, but he also told me how he thought the app could be trimmed as our app wants to achieve a lot in a pretty short amount of time. Another CI was with a student, TL, in the Stat 400 class at Horace Mann, who has been here since middle school. He often uses his first class email but his notifications don't work. We wanted to interview him since he experiences both sides of our problem; he plans to send out polls for the student body for data for future projects  and he uses first class as a student often. Since our app relates to our first class system, I first observed him opening his email and how he typically receives assignments. I noticed he had lots of unread emails, for example, lots of notifications from google classroom as well as emails from clubs stating their room number and zoom link (although TL says he is not part of any of those clubs, he still gets their emails). We conducted our third interview on a student with initials FV because we wanted to gain an additional perspective from a student who uses first-class as an app. Some of the main takeaways from this interview was that this student was also getting an overload of email and he thought that everyone was unorganized. When inquired about if he fills out the polls that publications or other clubs send out, he truthfully answered that he never fills these out, and he continued by saying he does not believe a bunch of other students fill these out either. This puts the accuracy of statistics that publications release in their issues greatly in doubt since very few people fill them out. 
         
  * In specific, the CI with LL pointed out the scheduling of certain rooms for club meetings, and how difficult that actually is because we would actually have to track users. But, he gave a pretty reasonable and timely solution which would be to use something like discord or slack to coordinate the scheduling and signing-up for certain rooms. Lastly, one of the most important pieces of information he gave me was how we could structure the interface as that was a problem that we were facing in the app. He suggested that we structure the app in a way that gives some pop ups, or highlights certain serious polls like polls for the record or polls for classes that need data. Furthermore, I was even thinking about how we could maybe create a reward system within the app in order to get these clubs and classes the data they really need. With the CI with TL, I noticed that his problems with first class dealt mostly with the theme of organization. His notifications donâ€™t work, which makes it difficult for him as he must constantly check his phone and log in to see if he missed any important information for his teachers or any relevant emails, while ignoring the flood of irrelevant info. Additionally, as TL is also a stat student, I learned that it can be frustrating if students do not respond to the poll since there is not enough data to work with. This often happens, especially when the poll questions may be personal or just long so students don't want to fill them out. This goes hand in hand with the problem of receiving so many emails as students that they tend to ignore the irrelevant ones. We conducted the third interview with FV on Zoom as we are all currently in remote learning. The interview went well and we could tell that he was particularly passionate about this topic because of how annoyed he was at the first class emailing system. Particularly, he believes that the things that most contribute to this overload are his subscriptions, notifications, and continuous emails from clubs and polls that publications send out. When asked about what he believes to be the main reason for students' reluctance to fill out polls, he said it was mostly an incentive problem; students do not have a real incentive to fill these polls out and they probably think that since there are so many students in the school, their vote probably does not matter. However, if every student has this mindset, very few people will actually fill these polls out. Additionally, there is no punishment if they do not fill the polls out, so students tend to be completely indifferent about the polls. 
         
## Task Review Questions:
1. Who is going to use the design? 
HM students, club advisors, and club leaders will be using the design. 
2. What tasks do they now perform? 
Club leaders will send out club room information, and members of the club will check their club room. Additionally, students send out polls as well as answer other polls.
3. What tasks are desired? 
The desired task is to provide a more efficient and condensed method to send out polls and schedule club rooms.
4. How are the tasks learned? 
Tasks will be learned through instructions given out.
5. Where are the tasks performed?
Students and teachers are currently performing tasks in first class.
6. What is the relationship between the person and data? 
Everyone who has filled out the polls will be able to see the collective data right after they fill it out.
7. What other tools does the person have?
Most people have phones to communicate with. However, it is not possible to collect data from everyone in the hm community since everyone only has a limited amount of contacts.
8. How do people communicate with each other?
Currently, people communicate with the first class emailing system when they are not together, especially because we are all online now. 
9. How often are the tasks performed?
These tasks are performed all throughout the weekdays and Sunday nights before school. 
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
There are no real time constraints on the task but it should be as short as possible 
11. What happens when things go wrong? 
If something goes wrong, another email must be sent explaining whatever error occurred which contributes to the flood of emails students get.
