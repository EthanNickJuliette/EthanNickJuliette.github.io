### Storyboard Summary 
We chose this design because it allows us to complete our two tasks in the most efficient and interactive way. It mainly bases around Nickâ€™s original design, 
with the addition of a few new features, such as a login and account system with their HM email, and including an option of seeing how many people answered polls
and rendering certain polls anonymous in the creator of the poll makes it like that. We found that the tasks we chose embody the 2 main uses of the app. 
The design we chose is better suited for HM students because of the efficiency, and intuitiveness,  that the design offers to the users. 
Our design is efficient because it allows for signing up for a club to be not only faster for the user, but more manageable for the stakeholders which are 
club leaders and club advisors. Lastly, it is intuitive because there are buttons clearly displayed on the screen with signifiers for certain actions that can 
be done in the app. We found sending out surveys and finding a club room more compelling than the other tasks because those were what we thought had the most 
demand among the hm community. Having another platform to send out polls is essential because of the overload of emails students get, and the process of finding 
a club room, especially during a pandemic, may get hectic at times.
